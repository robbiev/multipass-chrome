This is an unofficial [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/multipass/nogdingclealjiajkpbleapgdaakkpfl) for 1Password for use on Linux. It uses a native binary (written in Go) to do the interfacing with your 1Password files (using [native messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/messaging#native-messaging)). Only the "agile keychain" format is currently supported. Works for me using 1Password 4.

 1. download the [release package](https://github.com/robbiev/multipass-chrome/releases)
 1. unpack the contents to where you want the binary to live (I use `$HOME/bin`)
 1. run `sudo ./install.sh`, this copies a metadata file into a Chrome directory to give the extension access to the binary
 1. currently you need to put your 1Password files in a Dropbox location so that the following directory structure exists: `$HOME/Dropbox/1password/1Password.agilekeychain/data/default`
 1. install the extension in Chrome
 1. Ctrl+M to bring up the popup
